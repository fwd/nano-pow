## 0. Pre-requisites

- Ubuntu 18+ 
- GPU Recommended

```bash
# OpenCL, GCC & Build Tools
sudo apt install ocl-icd-opencl-dev gcc build-essential -y

# Rust
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```

## 1. Install [PoW Worker](https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-work-server)

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/nanocurrency/nano-work-server.git
cd nano-work-server
cargo build --release
```

**Setup Cron**

```bash
# crontab -e
@reboot ~/nano-work-server/target/release/nano-work-server --cpu-threads 4
```

Adjut ```--cpu-threads``` to your needs.

**With GPU**

```
@reboot ~/nano-work-server/target/release/nano-work-server --gpu 0:0
```

Adjust ```--gpu``` to each local device id. Setting up GPUs on Linux is not easy. Don't feel bad if you struggle.

## 2. Install [PoW Proxy](https://github.com/fwd/nano-pow)

```bash
cd ~/
git clone https://github.com/fwd/nano-pow
cd nano-pow
npm install
```

**Create config file**

```bash
nano .env
```

```
NODE=
PORT=
KEY=
DIFF=
```

- **NODE**: URL of NODE or Worker. Default 'http://[::1]:7076'
- **PORT**: Port for Proxy. Default '7080' 
- **KEY**: Access Proxy with API key only.
- **DIFF**: Limit PoW difficulty.
